  <h1> A (very) rough tutorial on how to square-knot a belt </h1>
    <p> If you know me, you'll know that I'm no photographer!  Still, in honour of a request I
        received from the Head Knothead of Knotheads Worldwide, I have made the following tutorial
        on how to completely muck up a square-knotted belt. </p>

    <h2> AN EXCELLENT SOURCE FOR MATERIALS IS MARTIN COMBS </h2>
      <a href="http://www.knotstuff.com/">knotstuff.com </a>
      <p>Tip: #24 line used below, for which 16 lines gives appx 1-3/8" width belt.  Smaller line will 
         permit more sets across for the same width. 1-1/2" is about max normal width!</p>
    <h2> initial setup:</h2>
        <p> My workbench currently is a hard-maple TV Table to which I
        have screwed a crossbar (scrap maple deck stanchion end)
        using a three inch wood screw and four washers between the
        table itself and the bar to provide spacing for the skewers
        which provide stability for the work.  I also "clamp" the work
        with another skewer which goes across the work and under the
        lashings shewn to the left and right of the work in the picture.'
        (The bucket holds ten pounds of "Sackrete" concrete mix
        which keeps the table from tipping over onto me... you can use
        that, dirt, water (not recommended) or a large cat, as you
        prefer.      (Pic. #0)

        To begin a belt (for real), one would larks-head the number of
        lines to be used around the fixed end of the buckle,  being sure
        that the tongue is in the proper position and that the larks
        heads are all facing up.  Here I have done this direct to a
        skewer, since this is only a demonstration belt and have lashed
        that on top of a piece of cardboard to provide a focal plane as
        well as a bit of contrast for the pictures. (see below: Pic. #1)

        Here also I show my "belly-hook" which is a piece of bamboo
        (from a toast-grabber! If you carefully separate the legs of the
        toast-puller you can get two legs! Such a deal!) to which has
        been lashed and glued a  5" piece of round chopstick.  By
        making up the standing parts of the knots as though the
        belly-hook were a dock bitt, you can hold up to six pair of lines
        at a time.</p>
